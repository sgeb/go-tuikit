An MVC framework for terminal applications in golang.

## Credit where credit is due

Tuikit uses code, ideas and inspiration from the following projects:

* [termbox](https://github.com/nsf/termbox-go)
* [tulib](https://github.com/nsf/tulib)
* [walk](https://github.com/lxn/walk)
* Some parts of golang itself, such as image's `Point`

Thanks to the original authors for making their code available. Without their
contributions to open source, tuikit would not have turned out the way it has.
